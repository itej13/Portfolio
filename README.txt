Mini Project: Personal Portfolio Website — Personalized for Tejas Das
Folder name: TEJAS_DAS_25/A05/077_portfolio

Included files:
 - index.html
 - styles.css
 - assets/profile-circle.svg (replace with your photo if needed)
 - assets/project-*.svg (placeholder images)
 - README.txt (this file)

Personalization done:
 - Name: Tejas Das
 - College: Delhi Technological University (DTU)
 - Contact email: tejas.das@example.com (replace with your real email)
 - GitHub/LinkedIn placeholders present (search for USERNAME to replace)

How to finalize:
 1. Replace 'USERNAME' and the sample email in index.html with your GitHub/LinkedIn and real email.
 2. If you want a real photo, upload and replace assets/profile-circle.svg or change the <img> src.
 3. Add real repo links for each project and update descriptions briefly.
 4. Rename the folder to your roll number (no slashes) and zip it for submission.
 5. Host the folder on GitHub Pages/Netlify/Vercel and include the hosted URL in a separate file if required by your instructor.

If you'd like, I can now:
 - Replace 'USERNAME' and the email with exact GitHub/LinkedIn URLs and your roll number (tell me the exact text),
 - Or add a downloadable CV button and more projects.
